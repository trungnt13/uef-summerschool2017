### Three datasets

1. Speech data: detect Parkinsons disease (PD) from speech signal (see description of the data [link](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201611))

2. Molecular data: this task will focus on cell type deconvolution where students are encouraged to innovate how to use single cell RNAseq data in a clever way to infer cellular changes from Alzheimer disease tissue data.

3. Imaging data: this task will involve application of deep neural networks for the analysis of imaging data from human brain to study genes that change their levels upon Alzheimerâ€™s disease
